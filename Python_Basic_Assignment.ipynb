        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation.It is so Popular because of its Ease of Learning use, Versatility and Strong Support.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire program into machine code before execution, an interpreter processes the code in a step-by-step manner.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers such as variable names, function names, etc. These keywords are part of the Python language syntax, and each one serves a specific function. for example:- True, False, None, else, if etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved words that have specific meanings in the Python language and are used to define the structure and behavior of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be changed or modified after it is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Lists are often used in situations where data might change, such as adding, removing, or altering elements. Immutability allows tuples to be more memory-efficient and faster for certain operations. Since their data cannot change. The difference in mutability between lists and tuples in Python is based on design choices made to optimize performance, flexibility, and use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, == and is are both comparison operators, but they are used in different contexts and have different meanings.The == operator is used to compare the values of two objects to check if they are equal.The is operator is used to compare the identities of two objects, meaning it checks if both references point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n",
        "  - logical operators are used to perform logical operations on Boolean values True or False. These operators are commonly used to combine or modify conditions in control flow statements like if, while, and for.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python ?\n",
        "  - Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting one data type into another. Python provides several built-in functions to perform type casting, which can be useful when you need to work with data in different formats or need to convert between types for specific operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "  - In Python, implicit and explicit type casting also known as type conversion are processes where data types are converted from one type to another. Implicit casting is performed automatically by Python when it makes sense to convert one type to another without losing data or causing errors.Explicit casting is done manually by the programmer using Python's built-in type conversion functions such as int(), float(), str(), etc. This is required when converting between incompatible types or when precision might be lost.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n",
        "  - The primary purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of a program by executing specific blocks of code based on whether a condition evaluates to True or False. This enables decision-making within a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - The elif statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions in a sequence. It allows the program to decide between several possible code paths by testing conditions one by one. It is short for \"else if\".\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Both for and while loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly, but they differ in how they control the iteration process. The for loop is used when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a sequence such as a list, string, or range.The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition being met.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and the loop should run based on a condition that can change dynamically during execution. For Example, Imagine you're developing a system that prompts a user to log in by entering a password. The user is allowed up to 3 attempts to enter the correct password. However, the loop should terminate as soon as the user provides the correct password or after 3 failed attempts. Since the exact number of iterations depends on the user input, a while loop is the better choice."
